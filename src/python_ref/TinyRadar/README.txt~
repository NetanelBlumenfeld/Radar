This is a repository containing the dataset, extraction code and training code
used in "TinyRadarNN: Combining Spatial and Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks for Embedded Gesture Recognition with Short Range Radars" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16281.pdf).
This project is brought to you by Moritz Scherer, Michele Magno, Jonas Erb, Philipp Mayer, Manuel Eggimann, Luca Benini of Digital Circuits and Systems Group of ETH Zurich (https://iis.ee.ethz.ch/), with the support of Project Based Learning Center (https://pbl.ee.ethz.ch/).

Download the Dataset

Tinyradar comes with two large data sets that you can use to run the experiments. These can be downloaded from:

https://tinyradar.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5G.zip
https://tinyradar.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/11G.zip

The 5G dataset contains recordings of 5 gestures using one sensor, the 11G dataset contains recordings of 11 gestures.
More information can be found on https://tinyradar.ethz.ch/.

Getting started

To get started, please unpack the 11G.zip raw binary dataset.
Following this, there are two python files in the utils.tar directory. 
Run extract_bin2numpy.py to extract the raw binary data into numpy arrays.
To apply the pre-processing discussed in the paper, run extract_numpy2bin.py.

The same process can be applied for the 5G dataset. 
Please change the following parameters to reproduce the extraction process of TinyRadarNN:

extract_bin2numpy.py:

gestures = ["FingerSlide", "SlowSwipe", "Push", "Pull", "PalmTilt"]
freq = 256
datasetPath = "./5G/"
instances = 50

extract_numpy2bin.py:

freq = 256
numpyFiles = './5G/data_npy/'
featureFiles = './5G/data_feat/'

Please note that while the dataset is quite large, with 5G.zip and 11G.zip both requiring 11 GB of storage, the unrolled datasets require substantially more space,
with the 11G dataset taking up 219 GB and the 5G dataset taking up 43 GB, using the standard extraction settings.
